# umBRELA

## üìü Instructions

### Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n umbrela python=3.10
conda activate umbrela
```

### If you do not already have JDK 21 installed, install via conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk=21 maven -y
```

### Install following dependencies for retrieval:
```bash
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu pytorch -y
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Judgment generation snippet

#### Setting up the model jugde:
Using a cloud model requires a configuration in the `.env` file or an explicit setting of environment variables. Here is an example of `.env` file to access GPT-4-mini (insert your actual secret API key below):
```
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=<INSERT YOUR SECRET KEY HERE>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=
AZURE_OPENAI_API_BASE=
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=
```

```python
from umbrela.gpt_judge import GPTJudge

judge_gpt = GPTJudge(qrel="dl19-passage", prompt_type="bing", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
```

#### Passing qrel-passages for evaluations:
```python
input_dict = {
    "query": {"text": "how long is life cycle of flea", "qid": "264014"},
    "candidates": [
        {
            "doc": {
                "segment": "The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day."
            },
            "docid": "4834547",
        },
    ]
}

judgments = judge_gpt.judge(request_dict=input_dict)
```

#### Evaluation for complete judgment:
```bash
python umbrela/gpt_judge.py --qrel dl19-passage --result_file <path/to/result-file> --prompt_type bing --model gpt-4o --few_shot_count 0 --removal_fraction 1
```
